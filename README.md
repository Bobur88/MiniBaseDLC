# MiniBaseDLC
Clone of the Oxygen Not Included mod "Mini Base" that works with the spaced out DLC

I really like the minibase mod but unfortunately it doesn't work with the DLC enabled so I created this.
Once installed You can find the asteroid in the "spaced out" section called "Tiny!"

# How to install
Locate your local mods folder, create it if it doesn't exist

# limitations
This is a very crude mod. Most modding tutorial I could find for ONI
were windows-only so I could not use them. As a result of that I only
edited the worldgen files (which are plaintext)

- Only a single variation can be played (no settings),
  it is based of the playthrough of Francis John: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwDlqMScMAs
- No special printing pod modifications, just vanilla setttings (minibase has a different selection and a 2 day cycle)
- An extra tiny 16x16 block asteroid has been added for Fullerene/Isoresin/Niobium, otherwise it would be unatainable
- There is a little bit of extra space around the base, creating a smaller world resulted in issues (crashing, unminable blocks etc.)
- No custom text, I reused existing text strings
- No custom art.
- I haven't tested it a lot, there could still be some bugs.
